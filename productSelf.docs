Explanation
The challenge of this question comes from the requirement "without using the division operation" With division, 
this would be an easy problem. In order to solve it, we perform 2 steps:

Iterate over the array from left to right, recording the product of the numbers we've seen so far.
Iterate backwards from right to left, multiplying each element in res by the product of the numbers we've seen so far from right-to-left.
